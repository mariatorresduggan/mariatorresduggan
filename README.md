Hi, I’m @mariatorresduggan. I’m currently a Master in Management student with a keen interest in leveraging data science and technology to drive business innovation and solve real-world problems. Currently, I’m learning advanced techniques in data science, including machine learning algorithms and big data visualization. I’m looking to collaborate on projects that combine business strategy with data-driven decision-making to drive growth and efficiency. 

Feel free to reach out to me via email at maria.torres_duggan@edu.escp.eu.
